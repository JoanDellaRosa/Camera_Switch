# Camera_Switch
Script to quickly circle around views of the default cameras in maya

You can inverse the order of objects in the list and then bind both scripts to a hotkey and have a back and forward button, alternatively you can add different cameras to the same effect but more custom to the scene

Works really well on 2024 and 2025, but for some reason it's really slow in 2023.
